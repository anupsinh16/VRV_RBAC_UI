Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI

This project is a User and Role Management System built with React and Material-UI DataGrid for managing users, roles, and permissions. The system provides a streamlined interface to handle CRUD operations for users, roles, and their associated permissions, ensuring easy management and scalability.

Features :
    User Management:
        Add, edit, and delete users.
        Assign roles to users.
        Display users in a responsive and searchable table.

    Role Management:
        Add, edit, and delete roles.
        Assign or modify permissions for each role.
        Display roles in a structured table for clarity.

    Permission Management:
        Manage a predefined set of permissions.
        Dynamically assign permissions to roles.

    Mock API:
        Uses a mock API (api.js) to simulate backend functionality.
        Supports CRUD operations for users, roles, and permissions.

Technologies Used :
    Frontend:
        React (with hooks)
        Material-UI (DataGrid, Box, Typography)

    Mock Backend:
        JavaScript-based mock APIs.

    
Future Enhancements :

    Integration with Backend:           Replace the mock API with a real backend service (e.g., Node.js, Django, etc.).
    Authentication and Authorization:   Add login functionality and restrict access based on roles.
    Audit Logs:                         Track changes made to users, roles, and permissions for better traceability.
